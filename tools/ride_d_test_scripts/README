Use these simple test scripts with the 'topos/campus_topo_tiny.json' topology file to test basic RideD functionality.  I basically just copied the command that would be run and modified it a bit to allow it to run directly in a Mininet xterm (I couldn't paste commands into xterm on my Mac).  This was much easier to continually run the scripts for integration testing and bug fixing than to re-run the entire framework each time, which is rather slow due to Mininet having to create the topology
and OVS switches...
